    ## Welcome to the MyWealthPlan Portfolio Alogorithmic Trading page.
    
    ### In addition to a 'Buy and Hold' strategy, MyWealthPlan offers a managed portfolio strategy that monitors daily market activity and places buy/sell orders based upon your current position in the portfolio and the current market trend.

    ### You may use the dropdown menu below to select from multiple trading strategies in order to compare their individual performance over time. Performance is modeled using recent historical data. Past performance is not indicative of future performance and results seen after investing and selecting any given strategy may not conform to the performance shown here.
